## Description

Neural Nets is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that cover the fundamentals of neural networks, their architectures, and their applications. The notebooks are designed to be self-contained and interactive, making it easy to follow along and experiment with different concepts.

The project covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction to Neural Networks**: This section provides an overview of neural networks, their historical background, and their significance in the field of machine learning.

2. **Feed-Forward Neural Networks**: Explore the building blocks of feed-forward neural networks, including perceptrons, activation functions, and backpropagation.

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Dive into the world of computer vision with CNNs. Learn about convolutions, pooling layers, and popular architectures like VGGNet, ResNet, and more.

4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Understand the concept of sequential data processing with RNNs. Discover various architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and their applications in natural language processing.

5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Explore the fascinating world of generative models and learn how GANs can be used to generate realistic images, text, and other data.

6. **Reinforcement Learning**: Discover the principles of reinforcement learning and how it can be combined with neural networks to solve complex decision-making problems.

7. **Advanced Topics**: Explore cutting-edge topics such as attention mechanisms, transformer architectures, and other emerging areas in neural networks.
